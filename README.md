# Docker Weekly Workshop

## Project Setup

- Create the following folder structure:
  - /api
  - /ui
  - README.md
  - docker-compose.yaml

## Containerize a React Application
  - Navigate to the /ui folder
  - Build a Create-React-App (nothing fancy - out of the box app will work fine!)
  - Verify `npm start` - will start and run your application and that you can access the default App loading page.
  - Modify the App to indicate each application author’s name (just in the App.js is fine!) 
  - Add a Dockerfile for the CRA
  - Build the Docker image
  - Run the Docker Image as a Docker Container 
    - GOAL: Make sure you can connect to that application on your localhost
	- AFTER GOAL: remove the container and application.
  - Use Docker Compose to execute your ui application.
  - Create a service inside your docker-compose file at the root of the file system.
  - From the command line at the root of your application run: `docker-compose up`
    - GOAL: Make sure you can STILL connect to your application on localhost - but using ONLY the docker-compose command
    - AFTER GOAL: use `docker-compose down`, verify that you can no longer access your application.

## Containerize an Express Application

  - Setup a BARE BONES express application.
  - Navigate to the /api folder
  - Create an express application set it up to listen to a desired PORT
  - Set up one root route to ensure the application works
  - ‘/’ route is sufficient enough, when you hit your root route - send a response with something like “My API is up and running Yo!”
  - Create a Dockerfile for the Express API
  - Build the Docker image for the API
  - Run the Docker image as a Docker Container.
    - GOAL: Make sure you can connect to your API at localhost and you see your response string rendered to the application.
  - Use Docker Compose to execute your api.
  - Add a service to your docker-compose.yaml file at the root of your system.
  - From the command line at the root of your application run: `docker-compose up`
    - GOAL: Make sure you can STILL connect to your CRA application on localhost, AND that you can connect to your API - but using ONLY the docker-compose command
    - AFTER GOAL: use `docker-compose down`, verify that you can no longer access your CRA or your API.
   
## Stretch Goals:

- Set up your docker-compose file to connect to a PostgreSQL image
  - Using Knex migrations and seeds, create/seed the database with the application's authors information
- Set up your API to retrieve data from your database to send as a response from the Express application
- Render the data from the database on to your CRA
- Create a volume in docker-compose to persist data beyond the life of your containers
  - To verify that data persists, use `docker-compose up` to start your application suite, connect to the database via the command line and insert a record. Run `docker-compose down`, then `docker-compose up`. Verify that inserted record persists even when you compose down.
